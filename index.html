            <p class="Fashion__description">Fashionable clothing in the early 1980s featured gender-specific and unisex clothing. Widespread fashions for women in the early 1980s included pullovers including the turtleneck, crewneck, and scoop-neck varieties, vests with fur lining faux fur coats velvet blazers trench coats made in fake and genuine leather.
                Accessories for women in this decade were mostly carryovers from the previous decade. This included skinny belts, knee-high boots with chunky heels, sneakers, jelly shoes—a new trend at the time—round-toed shoes and boots, 1983 Madonna-inspired jelly bracelets, shoes with chunky heels, tiny necklaces, and thin - with a variety of materials, such as gold and pearls and small watches.
                Hair in the 1980s was typically big, curly, bouffant and heavily styled. Television shows such as Dynasty helped popularize the high volume bouffant and glamorous image associated with it. Women in the 1980s wore bright, heavy makeup. Everyday fashion in the 1980s consisted of light-colored lips, dark and thick eyelashes, and pink or red rouge otherwise known as blush.
